    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mac and cheese is a classic American comfort food made with cooked pasta and a cheesy sauce. The sauce is typically made with a combination of butter, flour, milk, and cheese, and can be customized with different types of cheese or additional ingredients like bacon or vegetables. Baked mac and cheese is a popular variation that includes a crispy breadcrumb topping.
